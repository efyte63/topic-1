    <p class="yyy">A software programme known as an IoT (Internet of Things) application is created to run on sensors
        and connected
        devices,
        allowing them to gather, transmit,
        and act on data they produce or receive from other devices in the network.
        Applications for the Internet of Things are frequently utilised in fields including smart cities, wearable
        technology, industrial control systems,
        and home automation, among others. These programmes are designed to provide effective, automated,
        and real-time administration of connected devices and the data they provide.

    <p class="ooo">A smart building is a facility equipped with advanced technologies to optimize its operational and
        energy efficiency,
        comfort, and safety. These technologies include Internet of Things (IoT)
        snsors, building automation systems, and data analytics software that collect
        and analyze information about the building's usage and performance.
        The goal of a smart building is to improve its operational efficiency,
        reduce costs, and provide a better environment for occupants.</p>

        <P>A smart building IoT control interface would typically require the following high-level features:</P>

        <UL>
            <li>Real-time monitoring and control of building systems such as heating, cooling, lighting, and security.
            </li>
            <li>Energy management and optimization to reduce waste and lower costs.</li>
            <li>Integration with other building systems such as fire alarms and elevators.</li>
            <li>User access control to manage who has permission to control the various systems.</li>
            <li>Alerts and notifications to keep occupants and maintenance personnel informed of any issues or problems.
            </li>
        </UL>

        <p>The users of the control interface for a smart building IoT application can be building owners, facility
            managers, property managers, tenants, and maintenance personnel.</p>
